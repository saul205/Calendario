# Calendario
Calendar app that calculates the total of hours worked from the amount of hours worked each day

To create a calendar and start working, a year, the day that that year starts on and an amount of hours to work need to be established.
Once we set these three values, a calendar will show up and we can set any amount of hours on each day and it'll sum up to tell you the difference between the amount of hours that you work and the amount of hours that you have to work.
To set an amount of hours into a cell, insert the amount and press ENTER.

Once the calendar has been created, when the app starts it's possible to open a previous calendar by inserting the year of the calendar that you want to open.
